            <p>
              "What sweatshirt is that in the photo?" "Will this coupon code work for X?"
              Often times your customers are one simple question away from making a purchase.
              Don't leave them hanging.

            <p>Sometimes finding customer comments that actually require a response is
              like searching for a needle in a haystack. We have 15 combinable search
              operators to sift through the noise.</p>

              Your customers won't always directly mention you when they're talking about you.
              Stay on top of keywords and phrases that are relevant to your brand - or your competitor's.

              No more sifting through and skewing marketing reports to find actionable data for improvement.
